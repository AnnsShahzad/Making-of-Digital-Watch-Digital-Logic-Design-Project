# Making-of-Digital-Watch-Digital-Logic-Design-Project
Abstract: In the past, people used sand to count time. Some used the shadows of objects made due to the light of sun in order to check the time. That was very long time ago. Then, analog clock took birth and the ability to keep a track of time increased. With the increasing technological inventions, DIGITAL WATCH was invented. The first digital electronic watch, a Pulsar LED prototype in 1970, was developed jointly by Hamilton Watch Company and Electro-Data, founded by George H. Thiess. Introduction: The digital watch will be made by using the Proteous 8 Professional. The different logic gates containing different number of inputs will be used. Also, different ICâ€™s will be used. LEDs will be used in making of digital watch along with digital 7-seg BCD. Logic state buttons and grounding terminals will be used in making of this project. The final form of our project will give us a digital clock that will work just like any other digital clocks.
